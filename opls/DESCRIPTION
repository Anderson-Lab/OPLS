    Structures
Version: 0.2
Authors@R: "Paul Anderson <andersonpe2@cofc.edu> [aut, cre]"
Description: Implementation of orthogonal projection onto latent structures
    (OPLS). Based on the original method described by Trygg and Wold (Trygg J,
    Wold S. Orthogonal projections to latent structures (O-PLS). J.
    Chemometrics 2002; 16: 119128). Includes novel variable selection and
    n-group discriminant analysis. This software is provided "AS IS" without
